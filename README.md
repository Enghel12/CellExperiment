## Overview
This project simulates a cell population and examines the effect of a growth factor treatment on key cellular properties. It uses R’s S4 system to model individual cells—categorized as Stem, Differentiated, or Cancer—with attributes for division rate and gene expression level. The simulation then applies a treatment that alters these properties, allowing for before-and-after comparisons.

## Technical Details
- **S4 Class Definition:** An S4 class named `cell` is defined with slots for:
  - **Identifier:** Unique cell identifier.
  - **Cell Type:** Categorical variable (Stem, Differentiated, Cancer).
  - **Division Rate:** Baseline division rate.
  - **Gene Expression Level:** Baseline gene expression level.
- **Population Generation:** A total of 120 cells (40 per cell type) are generated with randomized values for division rate and gene expression level.

## Growth Factor Treatment
- **Gene Expression:** The treatment multiplies the gene expression level by a fixed amplifier.
- **Division Rate Adjustment:** 
  - For Stem and Differentiated cells, the division rate is increased (multiplied by a factor).
  - For Cancer cells, the division rate is decreased (divided by the same factor).

## Data Organization
- The generated cell objects are converted into a flat data frame.
- Data from the 'before' and 'after' treatment phases are combined and labeled for clear comparison.

## Visualization and Analysis
- **Boxplots:** ggplot2 is used to create boxplots comparing division rates and gene expression levels across the treatment phases, with facets for each cell type.
- **Summary Statistics:** dplyr is employed to calculate counts, means, standard deviations, and ranges for the measured variables in both phases.

## Future Directions
- Extend the simulation to explore different growth factor dosages or alternative treatment protocols.
- Introduce additional cellular characteristics or new cell types to enhance the model.
- Validate the simulation outcomes against experimental data for more robust conclusions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to model cellular behavior in R using S4 classes and simulate treatment effects with growth factors. The analysis provides insights into how different cell types respond to treatment, forming a basis for further studies in cellular biology.
